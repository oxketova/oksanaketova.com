The history of Ancient Greece has several periods. The main heyday fell on the _archaic_ and _classical_ eras. In the archaic era, art developed under the influence of ancient Egypt, but was focused on perfection and harmony of the human body. In the classical era, Greeks improved sculpture, developing the ideal proportions of the human body.

> The art and architecture of ancient Greece became the foundation and inspiration for the entire western world.

Greek architecture followed a highly structured system of proportions that related individual architectural components to the whole building. As a result, three styles or orders that determined the shape and decoration of the columns were invented: _Doric_ (masculine) had no base; _Ionic_ (feminine) had a base and a capital in the form of curls - volute; _Corinthian_ had a base and a capital in the form of acanthus leaves. The orders developed one after the other one.
