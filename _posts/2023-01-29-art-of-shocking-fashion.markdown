Fashion became part of art thanks to Elsa. She created fashion inspired by the art of surrealism and dadaism.  Her work was revolutionary from shocking pink, her signature color, to dresses created from fantastic ideas by artists such as Salvador Dali, Miro, Giacometti.

> Before me, everything was black or navy blue or gray or brown or beige, things like that, for daytime. I began using shocking pink and ice blue and all kinds of bright colors. Elsa Schiaparelli

In the rococo period light pink were popular in art and fashion as a color of frivolity and coquetry. Into 19th century pink was a more masculine color for boys.
only in 1937 Schiaparelli gave pink back to women, and it wasn’t a pastel pink but bright, saturated and daring.
