Fashion became part of art thanks to Elsa: she created fashion inspired by the art of surrealism and dadaism. Her work was revolutionary from _shocking pink_, her signature color, to dresses created from fantastic ideas by artists such as Salvador Dali, Miro, Giacometti.

> Before me, everything was black or navy blue or gray or brown or beige, things like that, for daytime. I began using shocking pink and ice blue and all kinds of bright colors. - _Elsa Schiaparelli_

In the _rococo_ period light pink were popular in art and fashion as a color of frivolity and coquetry. Into 19th century pink was a more masculine color for boys.
only in 1937 Schiaparelli gave pink back to women, and it wasn’t a pastel pink but bright, saturated and daring.

Elsa Schiaparelli, collaborated with Salvador Dalí during the 1930s and 40’s: together they created perhaps  the first art fashion, clothes and accessories based on surreal drawings by Dalí. The most famous are the _tear dress_, the _skeleton dress_ and the _lobster dress_.
