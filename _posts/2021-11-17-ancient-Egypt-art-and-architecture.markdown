The art of ancient Egypt was oriented to the afterlife and was subject to strict rules. The sculpture is static, like a column, but always with its leg extended forward. Painting was about stories of life. The figures of people were drawn from the most favorable, recognizable angles. The size of the figures communicated social status...

All buildings were very majestic, this to emphasize the insignificance of men before the gods.
The history of ancient Egypt is divided into kingdoms: tombs were built during the _old kingdom_. The first tombs looked like dolmens and were called _mastaba_: these tombs evolved in the form of pyramids. During the _new kingdom_, the Egyptians began to build temples and the columns became the main architectural element.
