Art and architecture of primitive people were based on religious rituals.
In paintings of this period the person was actually not portrayed or portrayed symbolically, because it did not matter for the magical effect, that was to succeed in hunting.

Small prehistoric figurines, known as _Venus figurines_, with enlarged breasts and belly, which may have been symbols of fertility, were made in different parts of the world.

Primitive architecture was a complex of constructions for living, celebrating rituals, or burial structures, such as _menhirs_ and _dolmens_.

A **menhir**, or standing stone, was a large man-made upright stone, whose size could be different, but often taper towards the top.
A **dolmen** was instead a type of olden burial and cult structure, usually made of two or more vertical stones supporting a large flat horizontal stone that looked like a "table".
