Art and architecture of primitive people were based on religious rituals.
In Art the person was actually not portrayed or portrayed symbolically, becose it did not matter for the magical effect on the image but, perhaps it worked in order to succeed in hunting.

Small prehistoric figurines, known as Venus figurines, with enlarged breasts and bell, which may have been symbols of fertility, were made in different parts of the world.

Primitive architecture was a complex of constructions for living, celebrating rituals, or burial structures, such as menhirs and dolmens. A menhir, or standing stone, was a large man-made upright stone, whose size can be different, but often taper towards the top. A dolmen was a type of olden burial and cult structure, usually made of two or more vertical stones supporting a large flat horizontal stone that looked like a "table".
