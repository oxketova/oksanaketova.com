I was born in Russia, for a while I lived in Sicily, but now I live in Norway. I am a self-taught artist. 
In my artistic practice I raise questions about the relationship between man and society through the prism of the body.
I am inspired by the art of the Renaissance period, and I based my works on psychoanalysis and semiotics research, thus endowing the images and colors of ordinary objects with deep meaning.
