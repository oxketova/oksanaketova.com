Oksana is a self-taught artist who is improving her oil painting skills. Her journey through life has been a tapestry of diverse cultures and environments. Oksana was born in the USSR in 1987, grew up in Russia, and lived between Sicily and Norway before finally settling in Switzerland.

Her journey as an artist began during her stay in Norway, where she participated in charity and group exhibitions.

Living among different cultures has enriched her perspective, imbuing her art with a unique blend of influences and insights. Sicily's historical depth, Norway's mystical landscapes, and Switzerland's serene beauty all find echoes in her creations, making her work a confluence of varied artistic traditions and personal experiences.
An academic background in psychology has profoundly influenced her artistic practice. In her paintings mythological figures come to life, and dreamscapes unfold with a surreal elegance, inviting viewers into a dialogue with their own inner worlds. The use of diverse mediums and techniques allows me to experiment with form and texture, creating immersive experiences that resonate on both an emotional and intellectual level.
