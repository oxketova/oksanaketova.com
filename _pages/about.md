Born 1987, Russia. live and work in Norway. 

While I possess a background in psychology, my recent years have been dedicated to honing my artistic practice, delving deeply into the realms of psychoanalysis, cultural myths, fairy tales, and dreams.

As an immigrant, it remains paramount for me to engage with cultural identity, particularly the collective memory of the land I now call home. Myths and fairy tales offer profound insights into the psychological fabric of society at large.

The ultimate aim of my artistic endeavors is to shed light upon the constraints of societal norms and expectations as experienced by individuals. By unraveling the pressing issues of our society through the prism of mythology and psychoanalysis, I strive to summon buried memories through a seamless blend of symbolism and surrealism. It is my aspiration to visually captivate viewers, prompting them to embark upon introspective journeys, drawing upon their own cognitive and emotional encounters. Through fostering constructive dialogues, my art serves as a conduit for exploring our complex relationship with ourselves and the ever-evolving world that surrounds us.
