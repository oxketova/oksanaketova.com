There will be a series of paintings with women in which I want to free food from ordinary perception, give them a different, deeper meaning.

  <em>Strong woman. Oil on canvas, 100x80cm</em>
</div>

Strong woman with eggs, where eggs are a symbol of the masculine. Today women often compete with men on equal terms, take on male roles, and i think for many of them this is the path to exhaustion

> Free the real things from the ordinary

Series of paintings with dancing people about emotions
