 **Strong woman with eggs**, where eggs are a symbol of the masculinity. Today women often compete with men on equal terms, take on male roles, and I think for many of them this is the path to exhaustion.

**Dreaming about Dalí**. I was inspired to create this painting by the work of Salvador Dalí: for him, the lobster was a symbol of sexuality and masculinity. In 1939, he organized the show _The Dream of Venus_, in which the naked bodies of girls were covered only by lobsters.
