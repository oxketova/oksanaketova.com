Drawing upon the insights of psychoanalysis and semiotics, I endeavor to forge visual metaphors through my paintings, with a particular focus on ornaments and patterns as symbolic motifs intertwined with ancient cultural themes and the art of the late 19th and early 20th centuries

The ornament was one of the first ways of knowing the world for a person through art, an element of a magical ritual, fragments of history, nature, and traditions are included in the patterns.

In my paintings mythological figures come to life, and dreamscapes unfold with a surreal elegance, inviting viewers into a dialogue with their own inner worlds.
