Paintings with oysters are my attempt to reflect the inner world of emotions and feelings through a “closed object”.  How often do we become their hostages?! 
Inside each oyster there is the main jewel - a pearl, in my paintings it is an eye through which the door to the inner world of a person opens.

What do you see in the yellow oyster?  love, sadness, hope?

> Shakespeare said "The world is mine oyster". 

Do you see surprise, fear or scream in the blue oyster?

The image of a fish for me is always a reference to biblical stories.  in the Christian religion, fish is associated with man.  Triptych "Fish" about a man, about his past, present and future.

The tail is the past, always figuratively, symbolically in the memory of a person.  The present is today, what is and what is not without past and future.  The head is the future, perhaps beautiful with many details, or disturbing...
