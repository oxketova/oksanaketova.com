Paintings with oysters are my attempt to reflect the inner world of emotions and feelings through a _closed object_. How often do we become their hostages?!
Inside each oyster there is the main jewel - a pearl: in my paintings it is an eye through which the door to the inner world of a person opens up.

What do you see in the **Yellow Oyster**? _Love_, _sadness_, _hope_?

Do you see surprise, fear or scream in the **Blue Oyster**?

The image of a fish for me is always a reference to biblical stories: in the Christian religion, the fish is associated with man.

The triptych **Fish** about a man, about his past, present and future.

The tail is the _past_, always figuratively, symbolically in the memory of a person. The _present_ is today, what is and what is not without past and future. The head is the _future_, perhaps beautiful with many details, or disturbing...
