My digital drawings are inspired by the ornaments of different people of the world and patterns of floral elements of the _Art Nouveau_ era. I am trying to unite two worlds and two eras in these drawings. The tradition of wigs of the _Baroque_ period and the ethnic motifs of the peoples of the world.
