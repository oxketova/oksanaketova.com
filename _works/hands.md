This is a series of paintings depicting hands, in which gestures are filled with color.

Hands are the main instrument of communication with the world. You can speak through gestures of your hands, you can feel through your hands, you can build and destroy using your hands, you can pray and you can sin.

But hands are not only instruments. From the era of primitive art and over the centuries, in different cultures, images of hands represented not just the personality of the individual, but also a magical, divine principle: hand gestures were filled with special symbolism and stories.
